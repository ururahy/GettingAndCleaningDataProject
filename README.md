# GettingAndCleaningDataProject
Project of the Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data

The project is executed by running "run_analysis.R" on your work directory when the data retrieved from the link https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip is stored in this working directory. Just to avoid confusion, you should extract the data from the zip file and save at your directory forming a sub-directory called "UCI HAR Dataset", and keeping the sub-structure that the data comes.

The output of the project writes a file called "resulItem5.txt" to your local working directory. This file is the result requested for item 5 of the project.
